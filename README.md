# Rutgers-Earthquakes

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to add multiple features to a map with earthquake data from USGS. An overlay is added with the geoJSON Linestrings for the
tectonic plate boundaries. An additional overlay is added for earthquake data with magnitudes greater than 4.5. A third base layer is added to show the map
as a dark map. The script is written in JS and run by an HTML file with CSS styling. The data is derived from the USGS site and retrieved using d3.json().
